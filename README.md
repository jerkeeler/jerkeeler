### 👋

I am a software engineer 👨‍💻 and adventurer 🧙‍♂️ (I hike, camp, backpacking, that sort of thing...). I'm currently living in Ann Arbor, Michigan and pursing my Ph.D. in paleoclimatology at the University of Michigan.

I also created [aoestats.io](https://aoestats.io) and am a big AoE II fan/nerd 🤓
